- CPU backend:              <!-- As of today Vita3K uses two CPU backend engines to run games: Unicorn and Dynarmic.
                            When testing games Dynarmic should be prefered as it normally gives better results than Unicorn
                            You can change the CPU backend on the emu settings -->
- GPU backend: <!-- Vita3K has the option to choose bewteen Vulkan and OpenGL, there is no superior
							option and one can have better results than other -->
